# Service Selection Card Fixes - Task Plan

## Problem Analysis
The service selection cards in NewHomeScreen.js have layout and text issues:
- "Select locations" text is overlapping and redundant
- Text alignment and positioning need improvement  
- Content needs to be more relevant and professional
- Cards need better visual consistency

## Current Code Analysis
- **File**: `screens/NewHomeScreen.js`
- **Issue**: `calculatePrice()` function returns "Select locations" when no locations are set (line 101)
- **Location**: Service cards are rendered starting at line 321 in `servicesContainer`
- **Data**: Service definitions are at lines 72-96 with base prices and descriptions

## Todo Items

### Phase 1: Fix Core Price Display Issue
- [ ] **1.1** Remove "Select locations" text from calculatePrice function
- [ ] **1.2** Show base price or "From £X.XX" when no locations are selected
- [ ] **1.3** Test price display changes

### Phase 2: Improve Service Descriptions  
- [ ] **2.1** Update service descriptions to be more informative and professional
- [ ] **2.2** Add relevant details like vehicle types and security features
- [ ] **2.3** Ensure descriptions are concise but comprehensive

### Phase 3: Enhance Card Layout
- [ ] **3.1** Review and optimize service card styling for better text positioning
- [ ] **3.2** Ensure consistent padding and spacing across all cards
- [ ] **3.3** Verify text doesn't overflow or overlap within card boundaries

### Phase 4: Add More Relevant Information
- [ ] **4.1** Consider adding estimated response times to service data
- [ ] **4.2** Add vehicle type information to make services clearer
- [ ] **4.3** Ensure all three cards show consistent, professional information

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation
- [ ] **5.1** Test service selection functionality
- [ ] **5.2** Verify visual consistency across all cards
- [ ] **5.3** Ensure mobile responsiveness is maintained

## Implementation Strategy
- **Simplicity First**: Make minimal changes to achieve maximum impact
- **Single File Focus**: All changes will be in `NewHomeScreen.js` only
- **Incremental**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
- **Conservative**: Preserve existing functionality while improving UX

## Expected Outcome
Clean, professional service selection cards where:
- No redundant "Select locations" text
- Clear pricing information always visible
- Better service descriptions with relevant details
- Consistent visual formatting across all cards
- Professional appearance suitable for security transport app
